# TutorMate Android App Setup Guide

This project contains a native Android wrapper (`android/`) that loads the TutorMate React application.

## 1. Prerequisites
- **Android Studio** installed.
- An Android device or Emulator.
- The backend server running (`npm run server`) on your computer.

## 2. Project Setup
1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Select **File > Open** and choose the `android` folder inside this project.
3. Allow Gradle to sync and build the project.

## 3. Running the App (Two Methods)

### Method A: Development Mode (Recommended for Testing)
In this mode, the Android app loads directly from your computer's development server. This allows for "Hot Reloading".

1. Find your computer's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.50`).
2. Open `android/src/main/java/com/tutormate/app/MainActivity.kt`.
3. detailed instructions:
   - Comment out the "Option 1" line (loading internal assets).
   - Uncomment "Option 2".
   - Replace the IP address with your computer's IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:3000?teacherApp=1`).
4. Start the frontend on your computer with host flag:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --host
   ```
5. Run the app from Android Studio onto your device/emulator.

### Method B: Standalone/Offline Mode (Production)
In this mode, the web assets are bundled inside the APK.

1. Build the React app. **Crucial**: You must specify your backend URL so the app knows where to fetch data.
   - Replace `YOUR_PC_IP` with your actual IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.50`).
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   $env:VITE_API_URL="http://YOUR_PC_IP:4000/api"; npm run build
   ```
2. Create the assets folder in the Android project:
   - Create directory `android/src/main/assets`.
3. Copy build files:
   - Copy the **contents** of the `dist/` folder (generated by build) into `android/src/main/assets/`.
4. Run the app from Android Studio.
   - Ensure `MainActivity.kt` is set to "Option 1" (default).

## 4. Troubleshooting
- **White Screen**: Ensure `vite.config.ts` has `base: './'`.
- **Network Error**: Ensure your phone is on the SAME WiFi as your computer.
- **Backend Connection Failed**: Ensure `npm run server` is running and the IP address is correct.
